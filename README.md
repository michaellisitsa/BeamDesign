# BeamDesign
A Python library intended to carry out beam / column design checks for structural engineers.

Currently this is very definitely a work in progress. Initially, the library will start with a check to AS4100, the current Australian Sandard for steel design. It is intended that version 0.1 will be released when a full AS4100 check is implemented. Other Australian and International standards may follow.

This library is NOT intended for use by persons who do not have an appropriate structural or mechanical engineering background. Design standards have many assumptions built into them that may not be realised by those without appropriate training.
